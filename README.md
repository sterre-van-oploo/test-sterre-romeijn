# Debugger test

<u>Read these instructions carefully</u>

For this assignment you'll have to find **and** fix as many bugs as you can find/fix **in the html and js files**. You don't have to find all bugs in order to get a passing grade. There are 10+ bugs ranging from spelling errors to site breaking issues.

**You are supposed to not understand some of the code in this project.** This should not stop you from debugging most issues.

I've provided the default debugging settings for this project. If your computer needed a specific setting, please use the settings you've used for previous exercises instead.

## Rules

**Breaking any of these rules will lead to a failing grade.**

- You have 3 hours for this test
- You are not allowed to use any AI help (also when integrated into the editor)
- Close any messaging applications during the test (Discord, Teams, Whatsapp, etc)
- Don't share answers in any way

## What to hand in

Write down your answers in the file called: answers.txt  
Each bug should be described as follows:

```
Bug 1:
What was wrong: "This is clearly a bug" was written on top of the screen
Priority: Low
Error message (if any): no error message
What solved the issue?: removing the text from the code
```

Send this project **containing the fixed website + updated answers.txt** to <m.de.win@sintlucas.nl> preferably in a .zip/.rar file.

## Tips

Even if you cannot fix a bug, write it down in the answers. This way I know you've found it. Then focus on a different bug instead.

There are no bugs in the CSS file. Any issues with the styling are caused either by the html or js files.

Make sure you write down each bug seperately. A button might not work because of a typo and the function it is supposed to call might have an issue. These are 2 seperate bugs.
